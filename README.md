# Advanced Shaders in Unity Tutorial

Implementation of advanced shaders in Unity like raytracing, interior mapping, parallax mapping. Link to the tutorial: https://www.habrador.com/tutorials/shaders/


## 1. Volume rendering

Volume rendering is a technique you can use to make everything from smoke to clouds. But here you will make a Death Star from Star Wars. This is a YouTube video of the Death Star in action:

## 2. Interior mapping

Interior mapping is a technique used to simulate floors in buildings.

## 3. Parallax mapping

Parallax mapping is a technique used to simulate texture depth. Here you will make a portal to a moving landscape, a brick wall, and a mysterious hole appearing in the ground. This is a YouTube video of the hole:
